# Raw Data

Each folder represents a single biome, which can be treated as the label for this data. Inside of each folder is a series of video files where each video explores a single biome.

#### Note

Since the raw video data is often over the GitHub file size limit, this folder should remain empty on remote branches. It exists to help you organize your local branch.
